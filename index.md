# Prologue

It’s time to give the world a young man’s *inner experience* of finding love. Young men need guides to make sense of the world and their places in it. I benefitted from several guides, all young women. Without them, I could not be me. This story is informed by my own experience and takes place over the span of a bit more than seven years starting in fall 1983, a period like no other.
