# Prologue

It’s time to give the world a young man’s *inner experience* of finding love. Young men need guides to make sense of the world and their places in it. I benefitted from several guides, all young women. Without them, I could not be me. This story is informed by my lived experience and takes place over the span of a bit more than seven years starting in fall 1983, a period like no other.

## Description
Everret is an almost fifteen year old who has contracted a raging plague of puppy-lust. Everret’s life’s goal is learning how to please a woman. He desires, dates, and disappoints several young women as he matures over seven years. Follow Everrett’s inner thoughts, feelings, fantasies, emotions, anxieties, self discoveries, and sexual escapades both alone and with with the alluring potential to someday “go all the way”. This story chronicles turning points in Everrett’s life, decisions that change his destiny. Everret’s relationships guide him toward a true love he can hardly imagine. It’s a treaturous voyage of self discovery filled with whirlpools of self doubt, shoals of unjustified confidence, and guiding currents of compassion and tolerence. Everrett is cringy, inept, precocious in some ways, and obtuse in other ways. He is sincere, nurturing, apreciative, sometimes callous, and often clueless. Young women in Everrett’s life demonstrate sensuality, integrity, and most importantly to him, how to please a woman. Only then is he ready and worthy to meet his match. Only then can he achive his life’s goal and find his forever.      

## Author Bio & Disclaimer

Erik M. Buck is a semi-retired Engineer, Professor, Manager, Artist, and Entrepreneur. He lives in a midwestern USA state with his wife of 35+ years and is immensely proud of his three adult children. Writing "Seven Years To Love" started as an intimate nostalgic memoire that morphed into a fictional story caputuring the raw emotions of the memoire while protecting the privacy of people in the Author's life. In other words, the emotional context is an authentic subjective representation of the Author's inner experiences but must not be construed as acurate documentation of actual events or real people. Furthermore, the narator is unreliable in the sense that the young man portraied seldom understands events around him.
